# Pasas1345 Map Configs
This is where all of my configs for my maps are.

### Stripper Configs:
They are responsible for any changes that I need to push without any map recompilation.

### EntWatch Configs:
2 Seperate Versions are included: 1 for Entwatch v3 and 1 for Entwatch v4
EntWatch is responisble for tracking the item cooldowns and restrictions of item usages

### BossHP Configs:
They are responsible for giving any boss in the map a visible HP Counter.
